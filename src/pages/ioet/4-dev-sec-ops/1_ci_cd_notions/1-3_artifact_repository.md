### What Is an Artifact Repository?

Artifacts are large binary packages produced during the development and release processes. A software application designed to manage these artifacts is known as an artifact repository. Using an artifact repository ensures that your Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) workflow is consistent. It saves time for teams and improves build performance.

### Why Do You Require an Artifact Repository?

Artifact repositories are now required for rapid releases. The ability to manage binary artifacts enables your team to identify and incorporate the correct versions of artifacts into their work more easily. Without it, you risk losing the benefits of your DevOps investment.

### Use Cases for Artifact Repositories

The most common high-level use cases in modern DevOps are as follows.

#### Build Artifacts

A build in most complex software systems involves multiple stages, many dependencies, and multiple components on the way to producing artifacts for deployment. Build tools provide a framework for managing these dependencies and optimizing the process of converting source code to binary artifacts. Maven, Gradle, Make, and Bazel are notable build tools, as are a number of language and use case-specific artifact management tools.

#### Deployment Artifacts

Deployment artifacts, as opposed to intermediate artifacts, are versioned, secured, and centralized as the single source of truth. These serve as the transition point from CI into CD and are frequently set up as remote repositories. Although binaries, setups like Helm Charts, and others are also widely used, container images are gradually overtaking them as one of the most frequent formats. These days, the most well-liked repositories include DockerHub, ECR, JFrog, and others.

### Key Considerations With Artifact Repositories

- Versioning Support
- Permissions
- Auditability

### Artifact Repository Types

#### Container Images

This category is quickly moving to the forefront of development teams' minds in a world that is becoming more and more dockerized. The main advantage of containers is their ability to ship all of your dependencies and code as a single unit. On the other hand, this has the potential to result in enormous artifacts and shipping vulnerabilities that are concealed beneath several levels of abstraction. The best tools in this category allow you to scan for potential vulnerabilities in addition to resolving the issue of layer storage.

#### Build Repositories

Maven repositories are a common illustration. They are utilized remotely, including several publicly accessible repos, as well as locally for intermediate artifacts.

#### Application Package Repositories

Package managers for many languages and technologies, including PyPi and npm repositories, are used by package management programs like Pip, npm, Ivy, and others.

### Artifact Management in CI/CD

A few simple, but important best practices.

#### Security First

Given the extensive access to systems and end artifacts, CI/CD was recently named in a report as one of the top targets for hostile actors. Don't implement security after the fact; instead, plan it into your pipeline designs!

#### Automate Everything

Automation allows for repeatability and reduces manual toil. Small inconsistencies in manual processes put you at risk of process breakdowns as well as failed audits.

#### Don’t Reinvent Wheels

Artifact management in CI/CD has been solved many times over. Don’t write custom integrations you’ll have to maintain later.

### Docker Hub

> [Docker Hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub/#:~:text=Docker%20Hub%20is%20a%20hosted,push%20them%20to%20Docker%20Hub) is the world’s largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers. Users get access to free public repositories for storing and sharing images or can choose subscription plan for private repos.

#### Docker Hub Features

- Image repositories
- Team and Organizations
- GitHub and Bitbucket integration
- Automated constructions
- Official and editor's images

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry

> [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) is a fully managed container registry offering high-performance hosting, so you can reliably deploy application images and artifacts anywhere.

#### Use cases

- Manage software vulnerabilities
- Streamline your deployment workloads
- Manage image lifecycle policies

### Packagecloud

> [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/) is a unified, developer friendly interface for
all of your artifacts written in any
language, delivered to any infrastructure.

Packagecloud supports most popular package types, from Java to Python to Ruby and Node, and more.

### Node Package Manager

> [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the world's largest Software Registry.

npm is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management

- The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
- Open-source developers use npm to share software.
- Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.
