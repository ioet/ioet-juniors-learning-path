### What is E2E Testing?

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a method of testing the full software product from beginning to end to guarantee that the application flow operates as planned.

The primary goal of end-to-end (E2E) testing is to simulate the end user's experience while validating the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity.

### Why is End-to-End Testing necessary?

Every program is linked to and integrated with various systems and databases outside of its own environment. Nonetheless, this complicates the app's workflow considerably.

E2E testing evaluates whether an application's numerous dependencies are functioning correctly. It also determines whether reliable information is being transmitted between various system components.

- Backend: E2E testing validates an app's database and backend layers. This is required because the app's primary functionality rely on backend capabilities.
- Multi-tier architecture: If an application has a complicated architecture with numerous tiers, E2E testing is required to validate overall functionalities as well as the interaction between particular levels in the design.

- Distributed Environment: E2E testing is required if an application is built on SOA (service-oriented architecture) or cloud environments. It is also required for programs that have several components that must work together to function properly.

- Consistent User Experience: Because E2E testing includes the frontend, it assures that the app delivers a consistent user experience across numerous devices, platforms, and environments. In this context, cross-browser compatibility testing, for example, is an important aspect of E2E testing.

### End to End Testing Process

1. Test planning: Specifies key tasks, associated schedule, and resources
2. Test design: Test specifications, test case generation, risk analysis, usage analysis, and scheduling tests
3. Test execution: Executes test cases and documents testing results
4. Results analysis: Analyzes test results, evaluate testing, and perform additional testing if necessary

### Types of E2E Tests

#### Manual testing

To evaluate compliance with the application requirements, a business tester pretends to be the user (on as many devices and screen sizes as he has access to).

- Manual testing involves a tester implementing tests by hand, as stated above. Human error can contribute to poor testing.
- Manual testing is easier to set up and understand.
- Manual testing involves less financial and resource investment at the beginning.

#### Automated testing

As the name implies. Automated testing executes software testing operations using an automation toolset or framework. In simple terms, it is a sort of testing in which a tool automatically runs a set of tasks in a predefined pattern.

- The learning curve is typically higher for automated testing
- Automated tests are run automatically. In many cases, automated tests can be more accurate.
- Although automated testing requires a higher initial investment, it provides tremendous ROI (Return on investment) as your testing process scales and develops. This is something to think about while selecting automated testing tools.

### E2E Testing Checklist

Because a user interface is made up of numerous elements, E2E involves more than just testing the user interface.

Following is a checklist that can be used during E2E tests:

- Database: The database used for your system would need to be tested. You might run tests to check that data is properly stored, structured, read, and updated.
- Performance: While a webpage may navigate correctly, user experience is also affected by its speed. As a result, it is critical to test the performance of a page or feature.
- Security: The security of a web application dictates how safe it is for both the user and the company. In this instance, vulnerability testing tools are very critical.
- Functionality: The primary reason for testing is to ensure functionality. All features must work as expected. Unit tests can also be used in this case.
- Usability: Components should be usable if they are functional. Users are just as vital as the tool, therefore tests must cover element events (such as clicks), proper navigation, and so on.

### E2E tools

#### TestRigor

[testRigor](https://testrigor.com/?utm_campaign=theQAlead&utm_source=qalead&utm_medium=e2etesting) is a complete cloud-hosted system enabling teams to create a much smoother test automation process. It is geared towards manual and hybrid QA testers as it is no-code, and tests are written in plain English.

#### Autify

[Autify](https://ai.autify.com/?r=qal-etett) is a web and mobile app automation testing tool that allows you to create, manage and execute complex test cases, as well as run thorough reports on tests completed. The tool provides extensive test coverage, including visual regression testing which will spot differences in your application and run tests without the need for maintenance.

#### Cypress

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/?r=qal-etett) is a front-end test automation tool that allows you to debug your front-end UI of your web apps. The tool provides a built in debugging feature and allows you to set up automatic retries and waits. Cypress also allows you to schedule your test executions within your CI/CD pipeline.

### E2E testing best practices

- **Build tests for all other possible workflows:** To provide an optimized, simplified user experience, consider the minor microinteractions a user may have while using your product. This covers things like creating and logging onto an account, navigating around the various sites within the application, and so on. Don't leave any stone untouched. Consider every possible user workflow as an opportunity to wow the user, even if it appears small.
- **Break larger workflows into smaller, more-focused tests:** Smaller tests are considerably easier to monitor and troubleshoot.
- **Design tests to be realistic:** All real-world aspects should be considered and replicated in the most effective E2E testing. For example, incorporate accurate load testing to assist simulate how your product performs in real-world traffic scenarios.
- **Automate and adapt:** Our E2E testing should be constantly expanding and adapting to support your team and your users' expectations. Introduce automation wherever possible to relieve your internal workforce of any superfluous workload.
