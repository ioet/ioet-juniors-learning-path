# Non-Functional Testing
## What is Non-Functional Testing?
Non-functional testing is another type of software testing which is used to check the non-functional aspects like performance, usability, reliability, etc. of a software application which is not tested using functional testing.

An excellent example of non-functional test would be to check how many people can simultaneously login into a software. [Read more](https://www.guru99.com/non-functional-testing.html)

## Types of Non-Functional Testing [Link](https://medium.com/edureka/functional-testing-vs-non-functional-testing-a08bc732fbdd)
- Documentation testing
- Performance testing
- Reliability testing
- Security testing

## Documentation Testing
_It helps to estimate the required testing efforts and track the requirements. Software documentation includes a test plan, test cases, and requirements section. It tests the documented artifacts._

## Performance Testing
_It is defined as a type of software testing that is used to ensure that the software applications will perform well under their expected workload. Performance testing is considered as a heart of Non-functional testing. It is further divided into a few types_.

## Reliability Testing
_Software users expect their software to run without fault. Reliability is a measure of how well software maintains its functionality in mainstream or unexpected situations. It also sometimes includes the ability of the application to recover from a fault. The feature that enables an application to automatically save the active document periodically could be considered a reliability feature. Reliability is a serious topic at Microsoft and is one of the pillars of the Trustworthy Computing Initiative_.

## Security Testing
_This type of testing may require a very mixed set of skills and is typically performed by trained security professionals. Security testing may be performed as an audit, the purpose of which is to validate policies, or it may be done more aggressively in the form of a penetration test, the purpose of which is to compromise the system using black hat techniques.._

**Hint**: A good way of memorizing the difference between functional and nonfunctional tests is remembering that functional tests target the _what_, whereas nonfunctional tests target the _how_. For example, a functional unit test of a sorting algorithm would verify that the input is indeed sorted. A nonfunctional unit test would time it to make sure that it runs within a specified time constraint.
